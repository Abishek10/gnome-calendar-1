### Views ###

Here, I'll place some notes about views

 - For the creation of new events:
   Views will provide one date or two (a range), in both cases the event created from
   views are all day event, so the date passed by the views to GcalEventOverlay
   should be marked as is_date views

 - For marking current unit:
   View will draw with selected_color the font of the current unit, so:
      December, 14, or the hour (in day view) will be drawn in a different color.
   View will provide a two pixels mark for the current unit in every view.
   So:
      week-view will mark the day of week of the current date, no matters
      which week we are seeing.
      month-view will mark the day of the month of the current date.
      year-view will mark as current unit the month we're living today.
