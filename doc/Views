### Views ###

Here, I'll place some notes about views

 - For the creatin of new events:
   Views will provide one date or two, in both cases the event created from
   views are all day event, so the date passes by the views to GcalEventOverlay
   should be marked as is_date views

 - For marking actual unit:
   View will provide a two pixels mark for the actual unit in every view.
   e.g. week-view will mark the day of week of the actual date, no matters which
   week we are seeing.
   month-view will mark the day of the month of the actual date.
