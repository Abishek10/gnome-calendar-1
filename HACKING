Code formating and ordering
===========================

+ The source file will keep and order of methods. The order will be as
  following:
  1. Private functions will go first
  2. class_init and init will go second
  3. interface init will go third
  3. vfuncs implementations will go fourth
  4. Public API will go in the end

+ Methods naming will be according to:
  1. Private methods will have no prefix
  2. vfuncs and public API will have the right prefix

+ The methods prototype will always be placed at the top of the source, in the
  same order as their implementation below.

+ Line splitting will work accordingly to Gtk+ code style, adding the following:
  1. Pure mathematic calculation can extend over the 80 pixel line
